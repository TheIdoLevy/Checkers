# Checkers
Welcome!
This is a Checkers game programmed in in x86 Assmebly - including graphics.
To play, you must have the latest versions of DOSBOX and Turbo Debugger installed.
Add the files to one directory called TASM.
Add the file to a main drive in your computer (e.g C for Windows users).

Open DosBox and type the following:

mount c: c:\ (if your files are in disk c)
cd tasm
tasm /zi base2
tlink /v base2.obj

Enjoy!
Note - this version currently doesn't involve the computer playing - this feature will be added soon.
